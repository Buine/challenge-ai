Deliverables
-
A working backend service with API endpoints for data ingestion and querying reconciliation issues
-
Implementation of all five issue detection rules, demonstrable with test data
-
Test dataset (generated or mocked) with at least 300 transactions including intentional reconciliation issues
-
README with setup instructions, architecture overview, example API calls, and explanation of issue detection logic
-
A brief demo script or recorded demo (optional but recommended) showing end-to-end workflow: ingest → detect → query
